HR MCP Server - Demonstrates hosting HR tools on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime

This MCP server provides 5 HR-related tools that can be invoked by AI agents:
1. create_leave_request - Submit employee leave requests
2. update_employee_record - Modify employee information
3. check_leave_balance - Query remaining leave days
4. create_support_ticket - Create IT/HR support tickets
5. get_employee_info - Retrieve complete employee details

The server uses FastMCP with stateless_http=True for AgentCore Runtime compatibility.
