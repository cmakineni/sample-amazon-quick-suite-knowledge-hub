# HR MCP Server Workshop

Deploy an HR MCP Server to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime and connect it to Amazon Quick.

## What You'll Build

An MCP server with 5 HR tools deployed to AgentCore Runtime (no Docker), authenticated via Cognito, and accessible from Amazon Quick.

```text
Amazon Quick  ──OAuth──▶  Cognito  ──JWT──▶  AgentCore Runtime  ──▶  HR MCP Server
  (client_credentials)    (domain +           (validates JWT)        (5 HR tools)
                           scope +
                           secret)
```

### HR Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_employee_info` | Retrieve complete employee details |
| `check_leave_balance` | Query remaining leave days |
| `create_leave_request` | Submit employee leave requests |
| `update_employee_record` | Modify employee information |
| `create_support_ticket` | Create IT/HR support tickets |

---

## Workshop Files

Upload these 4 files to SageMaker JupyterLab:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `HR_MCP_Workshop.ipynb` | Workshop notebook — run this |
| `hr_mcp_server.py` | MCP server with 5 HR tools |
| `utils.py` | Cognito setup (domain, scope, client secret, test user) |
| `requirements.txt` | Runtime dependencies (fastmcp, mcp, uvicorn) |

---

## Prerequisites (Infrastructure Setup)

Complete these steps **before** the workshop.

### 1. AWS Account

- An AWS account with access to `us-east-1` region
- Billing enabled (estimated workshop cost: < $5)


### 2. Create SageMaker IAM Execution Role

1. Go to **AWS Console → IAM → Roles → Create Role**
2. Trusted entity: **AWS Service → SageMaker**
3. Attach policy: **`AdministratorAccess`**
   - This is for workshop simplicity. In production, use least-privilege policies.
   - The notebook creates IAM roles, Cognito resources, SSM parameters, Secrets Manager secrets, and deploys to AgentCore — admin access avoids permission errors.
4. Role name: `SageMaker-MCP-Workshop-Role`
5. Click **Create role**

### 3. Create SageMaker Domain

1. Go to **AWS Console → Amazon SageMaker → Admin configurations → Domains**
2. Click **Create domain**
3. Choose **Quick setup**
4. Settings:
   - Domain name: `mcp-workshop-domain`
   - Execution role: Select `SageMaker-MCP-Workshop-Role` (created above)
5. Click **Submit**
6. Wait 5-10 minutes for status to become **InService**

### 4. Create SageMaker User Profile

If Quick setup didn't create one automatically:

1. In SageMaker → Domains → Select your domain
2. Click **Add user**
3. User name: `workshop-user`
4. Execution role: `SageMaker-MCP-Workshop-Role`
5. Click **Submit**

### 5. Launch JupyterLab Space

1. In SageMaker Studio, click **JupyterLab** from the left sidebar
2. Click **Create JupyterLab Space**
   - Name: `mcp-workshop`
   - Instance type: `ml.t3.medium` (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM — sufficient)
3. Click **Run space**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes, then click **Open JupyterLab**

### 6. Upload Workshop Files

1. In JupyterLab file browser, upload the 4 files listed above
2. Verify all files are in the same directory (home directory is fine)

---

## Running the Workshop

1. Open `HR_MCP_Workshop.ipynb`
2. Select kernel: **Python 3 (ipykernel)**
3. Run each cell with **Shift+Enter** — one at a time
4. **Do NOT use "Run All Cells"** — Step 4 (deploy) takes 3-5 minutes

### Workshop Steps (9 cells)

| Step | What | Time |
|------|------|------|
| 1 | Install dependencies (pip + zip utility) | ~2 min |
| 2 | Set up Cognito (pool, domain, scope, client, user) | ~10 sec |
| 3 | Create AgentCore execution IAM role | ~5 sec |
| 4 | Configure + deploy to AgentCore Runtime | ~3-5 min |
| 5 | Get agent ARN and MCP endpoint URL | ~2 sec |
| 6 | Store credentials in SSM + Secrets Manager | ~5 sec |
| 7 | Test — list all 5 tools | ~10 sec |
| 8 | Test — invoke all 5 tools with sample data | ~30 sec |
| 9 | Print connection details for Amazon Quick | instant |

---

## Connecting to Amazon Quick

After Step 9, you'll get 4 values to paste into the Amazon Quick MCP Client interface:

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| MCP Server URL | `https://bedrock-agentcore.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/runtimes/...` |
| Client ID | `abc123def456` |
| Client Secret | `xyz789...` |
| Token URL | `https://hr-mcp-1234.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token` |

### Sample Prompts

- "What is the leave balance for EMP001?"
- "Create a vacation request for EMP001 from March 1-5"
- "Show me employee info for EMP002"
- "Create an IT support ticket for EMP001 about VPN issues"
- "Update the email for EMP001 to <alice.new@company.com>"


---

## Key Concepts

### Direct Code Deploy

AgentCore supports deploying MCP servers by zipping Python code + dependencies and uploading directly — no Docker, no ECR, no Dockerfile. The `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` CLI handles packaging and deployment.


**Important:** `requirements.txt` must only contain runtime dependencies. Do NOT include `boto3` or `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` — they bloat the package past the 750MB unzipped limit.

### Cognito Authentication

Amazon Quick uses OAuth `client_credentials` flow:


1. Quick sends `client_id` + `client_secret` to the Cognito token URL
2. Cognito returns a JWT with scope `hr-mcp/access`
3. Quick sends the JWT to the AgentCore MCP endpoint
4. AgentCore validates the JWT against the Cognito OIDC discovery URL

**Required Cognito resources:**

- **Domain** — without it, the `/oauth2/token` endpoint doesn't exist
- **Resource Server + Scope** — `client_credentials` grant requires at least one scope
- **App Client with Secret** — Quick requires `client_id` + `client_secret`


### AgentCore Execution Role

The IAM role that AgentCore assumes to run your code. Trust policy must:

- Allow `bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com` as principal
- Include `aws:SourceAccount` and `aws:SourceArn` conditions


---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `AccessDeniedException` on any AWS call | Add `AdministratorAccess` to SageMaker execution role |
| `zip utility not found` | Run `apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq zip` |
| `Agent already exists` (ConflictException) | Add `--auto-update-on-conflict` to deploy command |
| `Artifact size exceeds 750MB` | Remove `boto3` and toolkit from `requirements.txt`, use `--force-rebuild-deps` |
| `Role validation failed` | Check trust policy has `bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com` with Condition keys |
| `invalid_scope` on token URL | Ensure resource server with scope exists and client has `AllowedOAuthScopes` |
| Kernel stuck on `[*]` | Kernel → Restart Kernel. Never use "Run All Cells" |
| `Could not load tools` in Quick | Wait 1-2 minutes — first cold start takes time |

---

## Cleanup

Run the cleanup cell at the bottom of the notebook, or manually:

1. Delete AgentCore agent: `agentcore destroy --force`
2. Delete IAM role: `AgentCore-HR-MCP-ExecutionRole`
3. Delete Cognito User Pool (includes domain and resource server)
4. Delete SSM parameter: `/hr_mcp_server/runtime/agent_arn`
5. Delete Secrets Manager secret: `hr_mcp_server/cognito/credentials`
6. Stop/delete SageMaker JupyterLab space
7. Optionally delete SageMaker domain

## Estimated Cost

| Resource | Cost |
|----------|------|
| SageMaker JupyterLab (ml.t3.medium) | ~$0.05/hour |
| Cognito | Free tier (50,000 MAUs) |
| AgentCore Runtime | Pay per request (~$0.001/request) |
| SSM + Secrets Manager | Negligible |
| **Total for workshop** | **< $5** |
